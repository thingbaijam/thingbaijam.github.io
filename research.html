		Machine Learning of Seismotectonics

		<p>
		To growing explore the abundent avaibilty of seismicity, application of Machine Learning (ML) tools
                are considered to advance our understanding of seismotectonics. 
		Key topics include: investigation of rupture characteristics of historical earthquakes, delineating active-fault seismicity, 
		and assessment of spatiotemporal seismicity. 
		</p><p>
		This research project is currently at an initial stage. It is envisaged that the ML algorithms will allow unravel interesting patterns in the observed seismicity.

		Advancing Earthquake-Source Knowledge
		</b></p>		
		<img src="images/eqsource.png" style ="height:110px; width:180px; float:left; margin-right:15px;"/>
		<p>
		Advancing our knowledge of earthquake-source is crucial for reliable seismic-tsunami hazard calculations. 
		For complete and comphresive modeling, We consider not only geometrical parameters, 
		but also those of spatiotemporal evolution of slip.  
		</p><p>
		We investigate source-scaling properties, and characteristics of the slip distribution using the SRCMOD database. 
		These properties vary in different faulting regimes, controlled by tectonic settings 
		such as seismogenic depth/width, and fault-dip angle. We also explore dynamic models derived from simulations
		 of spontaneous ruptures, to examine the kinematic parameters (namely, rise time, rupture velocity, 
		peak slip velocity). By reconciling the findings from source inversions and those from dynamic models, 
		we aim at developing a holistic framework to describe the earthquake ruptures.

		Generating Ground Shaking Scenario
		</b></p>
		<img src="images/smoothkernel.PNG" style=" height:150px; width:180px; float:left; margin-right:15px;" />
		<p> 
		A new workflow is developed to generate regional-scale realistic earthquake-shaking scenario. It adapts
		the widely-used <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/shakemap/" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank;"> ShakeMap approach </a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		Here, kernel convolution approximation 
		(kernel smoothing of Gaussian noise field) 
		is used to simulate ground motion residuals. 
		This approach is significantly faster than conventionally applied one, namely covariance matrix decomposition 
		(or generally referred to as Cholesky decomposition) technique. Furthermore, spatial conditioning can be achieved by 
		combining the unconditioned stochastic model with kriging interpolations. <br/>

		Advanced Pseudo-dynamic Rupture Model Generator

		  <img src="images/krupgen.png" style ="height:110px; width:180px; float:left; margin-right:15px;"/>
		<p>
		We integrate the latest research findings in a new workflow, for pseudo-dynamic rupture modeling 
		which emulate physically consistent properties of dynamic ruptures. 
		The workflow implements a stochastic approach that reduces computational time compared to dynamic modeling 
		for effective multiple realizations of rupture models. 
		Closely linked with earthquake-source research, the new implementation is expected to supercede 
		the existing <a href="http://equake-rc.info/cers-software/" target="_blank">rupgen</a> tool. 
		It will be also accessible on the <a href="https://github.com/thingbaijam/"> GitHub repository </a>

		New Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Model for India 
		</b></p>
		<a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/srl/article-abstract/83/1/135/143990/" target="_blank">

		<p>
		This project comprise most work that I carried out for my PhD disseration 
		(2007-2011, Department of Geology & Geophysics, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur). 
		An updated seismic hazard model for India was imperative, 
		given rapid urbanization and burgeoning population of the country. Existing one was older than a decade. 
		</p>
		<p>
 		The following were accomplised:
		(1) compilation of an earthquake catalog, covering period: 0162âˆ’2008; 
		(2) delineation of seismogenic sources using the catalog, focal mechanism data, 
		fault map, and palaeoseismic findings; 
		(3) development of seismicity models; 
		(4) nation-wide investigation of site conditions, using data from microzonation 
		   projects and topographic-slope map;  
		(5) selection and ranking of ground motion prediction equations for different tectonic provinces. 
		The hazard components were integrated using a logic tree framework to implement 
		probabilistic seismic hazard analysis.
		</p><p>
		Recently, the model has been revised by 
		<a href="https://github.com/nackerley/indian-subcontinent-psha/" target="_blank">
		Nick Ackerley</a> and adopted in the 
		<a href="https://www.globalquakemodel.org/gem/" target="_blank"> 
		Global Earthquake Hazard Model.</a></p>
